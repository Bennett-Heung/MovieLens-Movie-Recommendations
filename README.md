# MovieLens-Movie-Recommendations
Provide movie recommendations using MovieLens data. 

# File Structure 

The **'01_Data_Preparation'** notebook involves: 
* Setting up installations 
* Importing a collection of libraries across all notebooks
* Load data 
* Clean data for other notebooks. 

All notebooks follow up from the data preparation notebook and require to run this notebook. These include feature engineering and building recommendation systems based on a selection of data, as suggested by their notebook names: 
* **'02_Baseline'**: baseline recommendation system based on the top movies across a selection of genres and overall ratings  
* **'03_Genres'**: content-based filtering recommendation system based on movie genres from the movies dataset 
* **'04_Ratings'**: collaborative filtering recommendation system based on ratings from the ratings dataset
* **'05_Genome'**: content-based filtering recommendation system based on ratings from both Genome datasets
* **'06_Tags'**: collaborative filtering recommendation system based on ratings from the tags dataset.

Appendices are at the end of each notebook for markdown tables as reference. 


# Purpose

There are so many movies and online information about them to help viewers decide what to watch. With an overwhelming amount of information, it can be challenging for people to decide and watch a movie that they would enjoy. Recommendation systems are developed to help resolve this issue by providing movie recommendations. 

The following notebooks encode various recommendation systems using information provided by [MovieLens](http://movielens.org). Firstly, a baseline recommendation system is built on the basis of top movies from a selection of genres and their overall ratings. This recommendation system can be effective to recommend movies, although it is not designed to tailor recommendations from a user's preferences and tastes. Thus, content-based (genres and Genome tags) and collaborative (user ratings and user tags) filtering recommendation systems were developed in the concept to cater more specific movie recommendations to each viewer. Note that there are pros and cons of each type of recommendation system, and with the amount of information here, play as a key factor of the quality in movie recommendations for a viewer. 


# Quick summary about the data
The raw data was not uploaded to Github following the Usage License quote: "The user may not redistribute the data without separate permission."

The dataset describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It contains 27753444 ratings and 1108997 tag applications across 58098 movies. These data were created by 283228 users between January 09, 1995 and September 26, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.

The following five data files from this dataset were used for the movie recommendations: 
* `genome-scores.csv`: from Tag Genome, which is a data structure containing tag relevance scores for movies. There are 1,128 tags (tagId), with a relevance tag value (relevance) between 0 and 1 in terms of relative relevance of each tag for each movie by ID (movieId). 
* `genome-tags.csv`: from Tag Genome, which only includes references to the tag descriptions (tag) in correspondence to the tag IDs (tagId) in `genome-scores.csv`. 
* `movies.csv`: contains movie IDs (movieId), movie titles (title) and movie genres (genres) for each movie. 
* `ratings.csv`: contains ratings (rating) for each movie (movieId) each user (userId) has provided, as well as timestamps (timestamp) on the time ratings were made. 
* `tags.csv`: contains all tags (tag) for each movie (movieId) each user (userId) has provided, as well as timestamps (timestamp) on the time each tag was made.


# '01_Data_Preparation' - Data Cleaning
The following process the clean data are from the **'01_Data_Preparation'** notebook. The data cleaning process is to prepare the feature engineering and building of each recommendations system. 

* Duplicate movie titles in `movies.csv` were identified under different movie IDs. Movie IDs of these duplicates were updated to match the unique movie ID across the other data files, and the movie ID of these duplicates in `movies.csv` were removed. 
* Found not all movies in `movies.csv` were found in the other datasets - no actions were taken, rather this as an observation that some recommendation systems made here do not consider the full list of movies in `movies.csv` due to their reliance on the other data files.
* Title namnes in `movies.csv`  contained year numbers in them so a separate column was created to separate movie titles and the movie release year. 
* Some movies have missing tags in `tags.csv`, which were replaced with ''. 
* Timestamps in `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv` were dropped as they were not found to be relevant for the next steps. 


# 02_Baseline - Baseline Recommendations 
The (content-based) baseline recommendation system is built by returning the most and highly rated movies for each genre, with the option of movie recommendations set between a year of release range. 

The feature engineering process included: 
* Collecting to total number of ratings and average rating of each movie in `ratings.csv`. 
* Coverting movie year of release (year) from string into numbers 
* Sorting the number of ratings, followed by each movie's average rating for the dataframe of recommendations. 

Two examples of the baseline recommendation results are below:

# 03_Genres - Recommendations based on movie genres
This content-based filtering recommendation system tailors movie recommendations with similar genres based on a user's list of movie titles, ratings and genres of movies that the user has seen. 

The feature engineering process included: 
* One-hot-encoding each genre from a list of genres for each movie in the `movies.csv`. 
* Create a user profile based on the user inputs of user ratings for each movie the user has seen. 

For example, if a user has provided the following inputs: 
* 'White Chicks': 5 out of 5 rating
* 'Proposal, The': 5 out of 5 rating
* 'Mean Girls': 5 out of 5 rating 

The user profile is based on the dot product of these ratings with the one-hot-encoded genres that each movie is categorised under.

The recommendation scores are weighted sum of ratings, which are ordered to determine the movies to recommend based on a user's inputs. 

The weighted sum of ratings are calculated from the dot product of the user profile (see example above) and the genres that are one-hot-encoded; and divided by the sum of the user profile (from the example above, 30). These are the **recommendation scores** for each movie in the data, which is sorted from 1 - movies that are to be most recommended based on the user inputs, and 0 - the movies to least recommend to the user. 

From the example above, the top 20 movies recommendations based on the user inputs (shown earlier) are below: 

|    |   movieId | title                                                        |   recommendation_scores |

# 04_Genome - Recommendations based on Genome data 

This content-based filtering movie recommendaiton system is based on the relevance of the Genome tags assigned to each movie. Movie recommendations provided by a user providing a movie they watched only, rather than a list of movies and ratings they provided like earlier. 

The movie recommendations are based on using the Genome data files - `genome-scores.csv` and `genome-tags.csv`. Note not all movies will be recommended: 23% of movies in Genome data are in `movies.csv`.

The image and table above indicates that not all tags should be considered in for the recommendation system, rather the top number of tags should be to make stark differences between each movie. In reference to the table above, a similar to the elbow method on the median relevances were applied to indicate that the 20 most relevant tags were a sensible choice to characterise each movie. 

For example, a snippet of the 20 most relevant tags for the first five movies in the data file are below:

|    |   movieId | title                       | tag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The recommendation system involves finding the most similar movies based on the top 20 relevant tags. This is done by using a count Vectorizer (rather than a TF-IDF Vectorizer which down-weights some tags) to help build a cosine similarity matrix, which contains similarity scores between 1 and -1 (1 is most positively correlation and -1 is the most negatively correlation) for each movie. With 1,128 Genome tags, 1,125 of these tags were used in this process to develop a cosime similarity matrix with a size of a 13,176 by 13,176 matrix, where 13,176 movies were identified in the Genome data files. 

The recommendation system orders the highest cosine similarity score as the top recommendation, followed by movies that have a smaller cosine similarity score. For example, the top 20 recommendations for movie 'Up' are shown below. 

|       |   movieId | title                             |   similarity |

# 05_Ratings - Recommendations based on user ratings 
This collaborative filtering recommendation system is based on finding similar users (from `ratings.csv`) providing similar user ratings and user inputs that include a user's movie titles and ratings of movies seen. 

The feature engineering process involved finding the subset of users who have seen at least one of the movies from the user inputs. 

To build this recommendation system, the following steps were undertaken: 
1. Calculate similarities of users with Pearson's coefficient to find how similar each user is to the user (based on the user input)
2. Select similar users were found (positively correlated users)
3. Weighted ratings were calculated from multiplying each user's Pearson's coefficient (weights) by their movie ratings 
4. Weighted average recommendation scores for each movie were calculated from dividing total sum of weighted ratings by the total sum of weights
5. The highest weighted average recommendation scores were sorted, followed by the number of ratings counted, as the top recommendations. 

For example., the user inputs include:
* 'Breakfast Club, The', 4 out of 5 rating
*  'Finding Nemo', 5 out of 5 rating
*  'Toy Story', 4.5 out of 5 rating
*  'Up', 4.5 out of 5 rating

The weighted ratings are calculated by multiplying Pearson coefficients (weights) by ratings for each movie from each similar user (below shows the first five similar users only): 

|    |   userId |   pearson_coeff |   movieId |   rating |   weighted_rating |
|---:|---------:|----------------:|----------:|---------:|------------------:|
|  0 |      134 |        0.852803 |         1 |        5 |           4.26401 |
|  1 |      134 |        0.852803 |         2 |        4 |           3.41121 |
|  2 |      134 |        0.852803 |        10 |        4 |           3.41121 |
|  3 |      134 |        0.852803 |        12 |        3 |           2.55841 |
|  4 |      134 |        0.852803 |        18 |        4 |           3.41121 |

The sum total of weights (Pearson coefficients) and sum total of weighted ratings to cacluate the weighted average recommendation score from this example, (below are the first five similar users only) are: 

|    |   movieId |   sum_of_coefficients |   sum_of_weighted_ratings |   weighted_avg_recommendation_score |

# 06_Tags - Recommendations based on Tags 

This content-based filtering recommendation system is based on the content in the tags for each movie provided by users in the `tags.csv` file. These tags appear to be raw tags, rather than the polished tags in the Genome data files.

The feature engineering process follows the filtering out Unique tags in the data cleaning process done earlier. The findings and actions of the feature engineering process is below, involving: 
* Removing punctuations 
* Detecting and translating foreign languages based on the possibility that it uncovers valuable information
* Tags that are purely digits remain as they are - there is a chance they provide valuable information
* One-character tags are removed - interpreted as highly unlikely to hold valuable information 
* Names are converted into one word for building the recommendation system.

Building the recommendation system ivolved the following steps: 
* Applying the TF-IDF Vectorizer, rather than the Count Vectorizer as some tags contain words that frequently appear across a large amount of tags and contain insignifcant value.   
* Building a cosine similarity matrix from the TF-IDF Vectorizer. Note that the cosine similarity scores can be calculated directly using the dot product, given the use of the TF-IDF vectorizer. As a result, Sklearn's linear_kernel() was used instead of cosine_similarities() because it is faster. The cosine similarity matrix is a 45,935 by 45,935 matrix, derived from 43,623 movies in the `tags.csv` data file. 
* The recommendation system is based on inputting a movie and providing the number of top recommendations based on the most similar movies (from the tags), measured by the cosine similaity score (from the cosine similarity matrix). 

For example, the top 20 recommendations for the movie 'Dumbo' from this recommendation system is tabluated below.

Results: 
From experimenting with each recommendation system, the recommendation system based on `tags.csv` provides the most appropriate results. These tags strike the most balance between having the least drawback in terms of data limilations and providing recommendations based on a user's inputted preference or taste. Note also that despite the quality of recommendations does come at teh cost of requiring a significant amount of RAM to run this recommendation system, relative to the other recommendation systems built here.
