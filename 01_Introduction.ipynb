    "\n",
    "There are so many movies and online information about them to help viewers decide what to watch. With an overwhelming amount of information, it can be challenging for people to decide and watch a movie that they would enjoy. Recommendation systems are developed to help resolve this issue by providing movie recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebooks encode various recommendation systems using information provided by the latest and smallest dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). The raw data was not uploaded to Github following the Usage License quote: \"The user may not redistribute the data without separate permission.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation systems were chosen with respect to evaluating them appropriately across the same metric, the **mean average precision at k (MAP@k)**. "
