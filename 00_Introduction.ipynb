    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many movies and online information about them to help viewers decide what to watch. With an overwhelming amount of information, it can be challenging for people to decide and watch a movie that they would enjoy. Recommendation systems are developed to help resolve this issue by providing movie recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebooks encode various recommendation systems using information provided by [MovieLens](http://movielens.org). Firstly, a baseline recommendation system is built on the basis of top movies from a selection of genres and their overall ratings. This recommendation system can be effective to recommend movies, although it is not designed to tailor recommendations from a user's preferences and tastes. Thus, content-based (genres and Genome tags) and collaborative (user ratings and user tags) filtering recommendation systems were developed in the concept to cater more specific movie recommendations to each viewer. Note that there are pros and cons of each type of recommendation system, and with the amount of information here, play as a key factor of the quality in movie recommendations for a viewer. "
